          <div class="main-text">
            <p class="text">Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized
            ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
            offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds
            and steep fees.</p>
            <p class="text">Developers from several L1 networks are working to improve layer one scaling through methods like increasing block size,
            sharding, and introducing proof-of-stake consensus. However, substantial layer one upgrades require coordination among
            node operators and can take years to implement. Some blockchains intend to use L2 protocols as either a temporary or
            long-term solution.</p>
            <p class="text">Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (LN) is a second-layer scaling solution designed to facilitate faster, low-cost transactions
            on the Bitcoin blockchain (L1). It operates on top of Bitcoin’s base layer, allowing for instant payments by
            circumventing the need for block confirmations.</p>
            <p class="text">Transactions on the Lightning Network occur off-chain in payment channels between users. Only channel open and close
            transactions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Participants can transact multiple times within these channels,
            reducing congestion and fees on L1.</p>
            <p class="text">Critics target LN for its prevalent use of custodial wallets, as these demand users place trust in third parties to
            handle their money. Moreover, the off-chain method poses a risk: if nodes lack proper backup, it could trigger an
            irrevocable loss of funds.</p>
            <p class="text">Loopring uses zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) to batch hundreds of transactions off-chain and generate a
            cryptographic proof verifying their validity. This proof is submitted to layer one (Ethereum), avoiding the need to
            process each transaction on-chain.</p>
            <p class="text">Polygon ZKEVM also uses ZK-rollup technology to offer high throughput Ethereum transactions with lower fees. On the risk
            side, some believe that relying heavily on ZK-rollups can introduce centralization risks as validators and sequencers
            become key to the system.</p>
